# state_management

# Wrap-up

### In this project, I accomplished the following:
- Using StatefulWidgets and the setState method to trigger changes
- Using ValueNotifier and ValueListenableBuilder
- Sharing data between widgets
- Triggering rebuilds on one widget from another widget
- "Lifting the State" using Provider
- Leveraging more than one service using MultiProvider
- Communication between provided services
- Listening to changes and rebuilding using ChangeNotifierProvider and ChangeNotifier services in conjunction with Consumer widgets
